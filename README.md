# Conway's Game of Life implemented in C#

I always had passion for simulations and this was my side project to learn C# while coding something I really enjoyed.

There are modifications in the rules but this is mainly 23/3.

First version is based on console.

Second version is going to be using graphical dependencies. This might be the final version too.

Feel free to study using my code.
